This is the TouchSafe Restaurant Portal where the restaurant management can use various options and confirm orders and customize the digital menu.

TouchSafe provides two options for QR-Codes:

● There can be a single QR-Code for the restaurant but in this case the customer has to enter the table number for every order.

● There can be different QR-Codes for each table and thus the need for entering table number is eliminated.

updated in real-time. The management gets an option to either accept or decline the order. By clicking on the View order button, you can check
the order details.
